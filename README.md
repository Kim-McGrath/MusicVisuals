## Description of the assignment
For this assignment, all four of us each decided that we wanted to not only showcase our coding abilities, but do so in a way that could include parts of our personalities. After a unanimous decision to choose the song Chucky VS The Giant Tortoise by Dance Gavin Dance due to its moments of both high intensity and technical instrumentals and vocals, we each began to think of ways to combine our creative sides with our object oriented programming minds.

Each of us had our own unique interpritations of our sections of the song and thus we each pursued very unique visuals. From a mobius strip to unicorns, and from drums to fireflies, we wanted to touch on any and all possible lines of creativity we gathered from listening to our song choice.

Here is a brief overview as to what each section of this visual assignment contains:

- Lee's part: visualises the song with a mobius strip that changes the width of the strip based on the amplitude
- Kim's part: a circular waveform inspired by a drum head, with 3-D snare and bass drum renders rotating to the beat
- Ileana's part: a cube visual that explodes with a unicorn background image
-Eduard's part: a visual that draws an image background with ellipses that has boids floating through it along with a colourful ellipses responding to the song.

## Instructions
- Lee's part: Can change the size of the range for the strip 40 to 0 with the space bar, 'r' resets width, 'c' randomises the colour, 'p' pause/play rotation
- Ileana's part: none
-Eduard's part: You can add more boids with a mouse click and with keys 1-4 you switth through the visuals. 

## How it works
- Lee's part: fills a PVector array of the 3D coordinates for the mobius strip using the formula for a mobius strip then uses the xyz values to draw it using triangles (Trianglestrip) 
- Ileana's part:  makes a cube reactive to the audio with multiple smaller cubes inside of it that explode when the music gets to a certain point.

Using a render function in an Explode class I render the cubes, make them explode with antigravity, and it updates the cubes' position.
 ```Java
 public void render(){
        for(x = 0 ; x <amount ; x++){
            for(y = 0 ; y <amount ; y++){
                for(z = 0 ; z <amount ; z++){
                    Cubes[x][y][z].render();
                    Cubes[x][y][z].update();
                    if(((Assignment)p).getAudioPlayer().position()>time ){
                        Cubes[x][y][z].antigravity(position, 0.1f, 3f);
                    }
                    

                }
            }
        }
        
    }
```
Eduard's part: My visual works of grabbing an image I have found off the internet which is the campfire image. The image gets painted with ellipses that are in a for loop. It grabs a random coordinate of the image and then it grabs the colour in the coordinate. Then for the boids they are generated as ellipses to generate them as fireflies. They respond to sound and they grow and shrink to the beat. I have it set up as a build up as stages with the visuals. At first its just ellipses changing colour. Second one is a clear image of the campfire and the fireflies being traversing the screen and changing sizes to the music. Then we make the background become generated by ellipses to introduce the visual change and then lastly we have the fusion of all the visuals earlier to make our last visual which is the colour changes in the ellipses the boids growing and shrinking and then our campfire which is generated as ellipeses which could like like raindrops from a certain point of view. 

## What I am most proud of in the assignment
- Lee's part: Seeing how a shape can be calculated for 3D space and implementing the formula into my code and seeing it working 
- Ileana's part: Im most proud of all the baby cubes i made and the awsome unicorn picture that i found.
- Eduard's part: I'm most proud how I managed to get the boids to respond to the music and I have them work with my visual of the campfire.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
